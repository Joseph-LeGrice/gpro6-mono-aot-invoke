This repository is one part of a spare time project of hacking together a game engine. Specifically, this repository relates to compiling the C# mono gameplay scripts.

I began this project without any real goals other than to experiment. I spent around a year and a half in 2017/2018 fiddling around with it before moving on to something else. In that time I got a rendering engine functional, exposed a C# API to write gameplay scripts, and set up an automated code generation and compilation workflow.
